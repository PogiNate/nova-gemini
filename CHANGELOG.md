## Version 0.5.2

Headings are now symbolized and will show up in the symbols list.
Since there is no requirement that a 3rd level heading be nested under a first or second level heading, I haven't forced subtree contexts. I might revisit this later.

## Version 0.5.1

Minor Updates to how fenced code blocks and headings work.

## Version 0.5.0

Initial release. It works well enough on my machine! 🤞🏼
